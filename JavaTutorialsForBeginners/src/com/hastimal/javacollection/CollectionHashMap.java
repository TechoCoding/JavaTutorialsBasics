/**
 * HashMap maintains key and value pairs and often denoted as HashMap<Key, Value> or HashMap<K, V>.
 * HashMap implements Map interface. HashMap is similar to Hashtable with two exceptions – 
 * HashMap methods are unsynchornized and it allows null key and null values unlike Hashtable. 
 * It is used for maintaining key and value mapping.It is not an ordered collection which means it does not return the keys and values in the same order in which they have been inserted into the HashMap. It neither does any kind of sorting to the stored keys and Values.
